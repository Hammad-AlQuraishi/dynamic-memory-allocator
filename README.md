# Dynamic Memory Allocator Implementation for C
For one of my university projects, I had to carve up a dynamic memory allocator implementation (Malloc, Free, Realloc and Calloc) based on a simplified version of sbrk() system call. I have had a growing passion to code in C, and so would like to initiate this small homework into a full time project, with further different implementations to be conjured up in the near future. Implementing them is especially helpful as that gives me RedHat and BlueHat insights on how memory allocation can be taken advantage off and how that can be remediated/prevented. 

Nonetheless, here it is.

P.S. It still needs a little bit of fixing as there are some instances which lead to an incorrect block assignment (in terms of the size) which I am working on.
